 2.Output: The function will calculate the number of water units that can be trapped and display the result in the output field.

Visualization

 The function also provides a visual representation of the input and output. The input visualization shows the blocks of varying heights, while the output visualization shows the water units trapped between the blocks.

Example

 For example, if the input is 0,4,0,0,0,6,0,6,4,0 the function will calculate that 18 water units can be trapped between the blocks.

 Note:It will show RED colour for block and BLUE colour for water.
